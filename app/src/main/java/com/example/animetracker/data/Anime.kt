 * A single anime entry in the user's watchlist.
 *
 * [totalEpisodes] of 0 means "unknown / not set". [rating] of 0 means
 * "not rated yet" (valid ratings are 1-10). [imageUrl] and [malId] are
 * filled in automatically when added via online search, and stay null
 * for manually-added entries. [durationMinutes] is the runtime of a single
 * episode, used to calculate total watch time; defaults to 24 (a typical
 * TV episode) for manually-added entries where it's unknown.
